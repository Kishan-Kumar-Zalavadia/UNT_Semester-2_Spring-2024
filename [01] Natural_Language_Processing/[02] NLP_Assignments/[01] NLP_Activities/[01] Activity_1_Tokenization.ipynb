        "Natural language processing (NLP) has made substantial advances in the past few years due to the success of [modern techniques](https://nlpoverview.com/) that are based on [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning). With the rise of the popularity of NLP and the availability of different forms of large-scale data, it is now even more imperative to understand the inner workings of NLP techniques and concepts, from first principles, as they find their way into real-world usage and applications that affect society at large. Building intuitions and having a solid grasp of concepts are both important for coming up with innovative techniques, improving research, and building safe, human-centered AI and NLP technologies.\n",

Some of these techniques include *lemmatization*, *stemming*, *tokenization*, and *sentence segmentation*. These are all important techniques to train efficient and effective NLP models. Along the way, we will also cover best practices and common mistakes to avoid when training and building NLP models. We also provide some exercises for you to keep practicing and exploring some ideas.\n",

Along the way, we will also cover best practices, share important references, point out common mistakes to avoid when training and building NLP models, and discuss what lies ahead.\n",

Either over open ocean, or on drone ships.  \\r\\n\\t\\tThe first successful landing occurred on land at Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>The East coast drone ship, servicing missions launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Kennedy Space Center, is named \"Of Course I Still Love You\".</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>On the West coast, \"Just Read The Instructions\" supports mission

technology. \\r\\n\\t\\tThe rocket features a modified Falcon 9 first stage, with two additional stages used as strap-on boosters.\\r\\n\\t\\tThe second stage and fairing is similar to those used on the existing Falcon 9.</p>\\r\\n\\t<p>For most payloads, the three booster stages will be recoverable.</p>\\r\\n  <h3>First Test Flight</h3>\\r\\n\\t<p>The first Falcon Heavy test flight was flown on 6 Feb 2018.  \\r\\n\\t\\tThe successful mission was launched from pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center and placed the payload, \\r\\n\\t\\ta Tesla roadster, into a heliocentric orbit with an aphelion beyond the orbit of Mars.\\r\\n\\t\\tAttempts were made to recover all three boosters.  Each of the side boosters returned to successful landings at Cape Canaveral.\\r\\n\\t\\tThe planned core stage landing, on a barge at sea, failed.\\r\\n\\t\\tBoth side boosters were making their 2nd flight, each having launched payloads on previous missions.</p>\\r\\n  <h3>Future Uses</h3>\\r\\n\\t<p>Future payloads may include large communications satellites, Department of Defense payloads, and interplanetary missions.</p>\\r\\n\\t</div><div class=\"spacer\"></div>\\r\\n</article>\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/\"><img src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/3.0/us/88x31.png\" alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" /></a> Images by <a href=\"https://historicspacecraft.com/about.html#Image_Use\">Richard Kruse</a> are licensed under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/\">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</main>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div id=\"right_content\">\\r\\n\\r\\n<article style=\"padding:5px;\">\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\"share-buttons\">\\r\\n  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&t=\" title=\"Share on Facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"window.open(\\'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=\\' + encodeURIComponent(document.URL) + \\'&t=\\' + encodeURIComponent(document.URL));

A single Merlin engine powered the first stage, while a Kestral engine powered the second stage.  Both engines were designed and built by SpaceX.Five Falcon 1 rockets were launched between 2006 and 2009.  The first three flights ended in failure, while the last two were successful.  All flights were launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.Falcon 9Falcon 9 is a two stage space launch vehicle developed by SpaceX.  Both stages are fueled with RP-1 kerosene and liquid oxygen.  \n",
            "\t\tThe first stage is propelled by nine Merlin engines, while the second stage uses a single Merlin engine modified for use in the upper stage.SpaceX builds both stages in-house at their production facility in Hawthorne, California.  \n",
            "\t\tStages are test-fired at a facility near McGregor, Texas, before shipping to Cape Canaveral or Vandenberg Air Force base for launch.The first Falcon 9 orbital mission was flown in June 2010.SpaceX is developing technology to allow reuse of Falcon rocket first stages.Falcon 9 v1.1First flown in September, 2013, The Falcon 9 version 1.1 (right) featured significantly improved performance.  \n",
            "\t\tUpgrades included lengthened propellant tanks, upgraded engines, and a new thrust structure.\n",
            "\t\tThe first stage was designed to perform a controlled reentry and propulsive landing after completing its mission.The first stage rocket arrangement changed from a three-by-three grid layout to a circular layout of eight engines surrounding a center engine.Fifteen Falcon 9 1.1 rockets flew before beign replaced by the improved Falcon 9 FT.Falcon 9 FTThe Falcon 9 FT, sometimes referred to as \"Full Thrust\" or version 1.2, was first flown in December 2015.  \n",

            "\t\tAfter stage separation, the first stage uses gas jets to flip over, orienting itself toward its landing site.  \n",
            "\t\tA main engine burn is conducted to cancel the downrange momentum and propel the rocket toward the planned landing site.Reentry BurnAs the rocket falls toward the atmosphere, the stage reorientates itself to point its engines into the direction of flight.  \n",
            "\t\tA burn is conducted to slow the rockets descent, reducing atmospheric heating.  \n",
            "\t\tAs denser atmosphere is encountered, four grid fins, located on the interstage, help control the rockets attitude and trajectory.Landing BurnThe rocket is in free-fall for most of the descent through the atmosphere.  \n",
            "\t\tAs the landing site is neared, a final burn is initiated to slow the rocket.  \n",
            "\t\tSeconds before touchdown, four landing legs are deployed.Landing SitesWhen fuel margins are sufficient, a boost-back burn and return to launch site landing is possible.  \n",
            "\t\tHowever some missions, such as those launching heavy GTO payloads, may have insufficient fuel margins to conduct the boost-back burn.  \n",
            "\t\tIn these cases, recovery may be accomplished downrange by landing on specially constructed drone ships at sea.Early landing experiments, with operational boosters, occurred at sea.  Either over open ocean, or on drone ships.  \n",
